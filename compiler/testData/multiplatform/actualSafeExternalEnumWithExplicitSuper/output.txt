This build uses unsafe internal compiler arguments:

This mode is not recommended for production use,
as no stability/compatibility guarantees are given on
compiler or generated code. Use it at your own risk!

warning: following manually enabled features will force generation of pre-release binaries: SafeExternalEnums
warning: ==========
This project currently uses the Kotlin/JS Legacy compiler backend, which has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Please migrate your project to the new IR-based compiler (https://kotl.in/jsir).
Because your build tool will not support the new Kotlin/JS compiler, you will also need to migrate to Gradle.

You can continue to use the deprecated legacy compiler in the current version of the toolchain by providing the compiler option -Xuse-deprecated-legacy-compiler.
